We may also collect information from advertising platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about purchases and interests.

In more detail, depending on which of our Services you interact with we may collect and process the following types of information:

    •    details about how you use and interact with our games, advertising and other Services (for example, information about how and when you play our games or visit our website(s), what device you use to access our games and services or details regarding profile visits, as set out in the section entitled "Profile" in section 3, below);

5.  Advertising and promotion

What adverts you may see as a result of playing our games or using our Services
We promote our own games and services in a number of ways. That might include cross promoting one of our games while you are playing a different game of ours. It might also include advertising our games within websites and other media published by others, or sending you marketing materials by email.

We may use information about you in connection with advertising. This includes using information that we have about you, such as the games you play, to try to make sure you only see advertising that might be of interest to you. We may also use the information that we have about you to help a third party deliver advertisements that are tailored to you based on a determination of your characteristics or interests by us based on the information that we have about you.

As well as advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate third parties to optimise their advertising of their own goods and services by helping them to target those ads to those that might be most interested in them. These advertisements may be shown within our games or within websites and other media which are published by others and optimised by us or using our information. This is done using anonymised information and we won't hand over or sell any of your personal information to third party advertisers.

We will also use information about your particular device in order to show you adverts which work properly on that device, or to measure the effectiveness of our ad campaigns and we may also retain information about how many times you have seen a particular advertisement so we can stop you from seeing it too many times.

Advertising partners

When we advertise our games, we may use various third party advertising partners, including ad exchanges, ad networks and ad servers.

Our advertising partners help us to serve advertisements to you. Some of this technology also helps us to make decisions as to whether or not to show a particular advert to you - for example, by informing us that you have shown an interest in similar goods or services previously.

Our advertising partners may collect information about you when you use our services or the services of others. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection of your information by our advertising partners, and we therefore recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information. 

How do ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies work?

Advertisers on mobile devices sometimes use advertising (or ad) identifiers to enable and optimise their advertising. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising, or IDFA. See below for you can reset these identifiers or indicate your preference that they should not be used for advertising purposes.

We and third parties who advertise on our Services may use cookies or similar technologies such as tracking pixels in their advertising. These technologies operate either by: (i) placing a small file which stores some information on your computer or mobile device; and/or (ii) by accessing information on your device. These technologies allow the collection of data, such as your device's model, operating system and screen size, the other applications installed on your device, and information about how you use our services.

How to adjust your preferences

You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.

You can disable cookies through your web or phone browser settings.

Although we and our advertising partners use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies to enable us and third parties to provide more relevant advertising to you, these technologies also:

    •    allow us to recognise you and your device;
    •    allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction);
    •    allow our payment processors to process your payment instructions; and
    •    enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our services in the correct language.
  
As a result, if you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that you cannot enjoy the full use of our services.

Please note that adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive adverts, it only means the adverts you do see will be less relevant to your interests.

Alternatively, if you do not wish us to collect data as described in this section, you should stop using our services.
